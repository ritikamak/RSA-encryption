# RSA-encryption
An implementation of RSA encryption; generating keypairs/digital signatures.
MyKeyGen.java program generates a 1024-bit RSA keypair and stores the public and private keys in files named pubkey.rsa and privkey.rsa respectively. MySign.java program generates and verifies digital signatures using a SHA-256 hash.
